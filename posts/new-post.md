summary: "My commitment to social change took me from community organizing to
  Toronto City Hall where I served as press secretary and senior advisor to
  Toronto Mayor David Miller. I saw first-hand how the biggest challenges
  thoughtful policies and smart projects faced were based on misunderstandings
  and poor communication. "
