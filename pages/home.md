    headline: Putting progressive ideas to work through strategy, dialogue, advocacy
      and action.
    text: >-
      I am veteran communicator, organiser and educator. My entire career has
      been at the intersection of politics, policy, and public engagement. I
      work with clients and partners to guide progressive, sustainable projects
      and policies from concept to completion.


      My commitment to social change took me from community organizing to Toronto City Hall where I served as press secretary and senior advisor to Toronto Mayor David Miller. I saw first-hand how the biggest challenges thoughtful policies and smart projects faced were based on misunderstandings and poor communication. A network of light rail lines bringing higher order transit to the suburbs, for example, was taken as the first shot fired in the “war on the car”.


      After leaving City Hall, I joined Argyle Public Relationships to help bring the light rail lines to life and learn a real trade. In my eight years there, I worked on high-profile public issues such as transit investment and expansion, carbon pricing, science education, childcare, anti-racism, climate change, and public health. 


      In 2019, I set up my own practice to focus on helping communities and movements advocate for progressive and sustainable change.
