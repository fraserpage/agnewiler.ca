    headline: Putting progressive ideas to work through strategy, dialogue, advocacy
      and action.
    text: >-
      My entire career has been at the intersection of politics, policy, and
      public engagement. I work with clients and partners to guide progressive,
      sustainable projects and policies from concept to completion.


      My commitment to social change took me from community organizing to Toronto City Hall where I served as press secretary and senior advisor to Toronto Mayor David Miller. I saw first-hand how the biggest challenges policies and projects faced were misunderstanding and poor communication.


      After leaving City Hall, I joined Argyle Public Relationships where I worked on high-profile public issues such as transit investment and expansion, carbon pricing, science education, childcare, anti-racism, climate change, and public health.Â 


      In 2019, I set up my own practice to focus on helping communities and movements advocate for progressive and sustainable change.
