      eCompliance is committed to providing a respectful, accessible, and
      inclusive environment for all our employees and clients in the Province of
      Ontario. Our goal is to meet the standards outlined in the province’s
      Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) and to break down
      barriers to services and employment opportunities provided by eCompliance.


      **Background**


      The purpose of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) is to remove barriers for people with disabilities and to work towards achieving a fully accessible Ontario by 2025. All organizations in Ontario with one or more employees must adhere to the following Accessibility


      Standards as compliance dates come into effect:\

       • Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation (IASR) (Ontario Regulation 191/11)\

       • Customer Service ○ Information and Communications\

       • Employment\

       • Transportation\

       • Design of Public Spaces (Built Environment)


      **What is Considered a Disability Under the AODA and It’s Standards?**


      The AODA uses the same definition of “disability” as the Ontario Human Rights Code, which includes both visible and invisible disabilities. All disabilities – whether temporary, short-term, long-term, or permanent – are included in this definition. It is important to understand that the emphasis of the AODA is not on specific disabilities but is on removing barriers to accessibility of goods and services.


      **Some Examples Of Types Of Disabilities Covered By The Aoda Include:**


      • Mobility\

       • Vision\

       • Hearing\

       • Speech or communication\

       • Mental health\

       • Developmental or intellectual\

       • Chronic diseases or conditions


      **Guiding Principals**


      The principles of the AODA assist eCompliance and its employees in taking reasonable efforts and making decisions to ensure that services are as accessible and inclusive as possible. The four guiding principles of the AODA focus on recognizing that all people with disabilities are entitled to:\

       • Independence – Independence means creating an environment in which people with disabilities are able to do things on their own, without unnecessary help or interference from others.\

       • Dignity – Treating people with dignity means not treating people with disabilities as an afterthought or forcing them to accept lesser quality or convenience, but instead enabling people with disabilities to maintain self-respect and the respect of others.\

       • Integration – Integration allows people with disabilities to benefit from the same interactions in the same place and in the same or similar ways as people without disabilities.\

       • Equal opportunity – Equal opportunity means ensuring that people with disabilities are afforded the same choices, benefits, and opportunities as people with disabilities.
